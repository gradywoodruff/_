## Git
### Things learned
* Commit locally often
* Create new branches for each feature


### General
Check the status

	git status

Check the branches

	git branch

### Git Push coasssst

	git add -A
	git commit -m 'commit messageâ€™
	git push origin master

### Branches
To make a new branch

	git checkout -b new-branch

Go back to master branch and merge
	
	git checkout master
	git merge new-branch

And then to delete the branch

	git branch -d new-branch

(`-d` will work if the commits are up-to-date. If not you have to use `-D` to force the delete)

### Mistakes
If I have to force a push

	git push origin master -f

Reverting commits

	git revert -n HEAD~3..HEAD  # prepare a new commit reverting last 3 commits
	git commit -m 'commit message'
	git push origin master  # regular push
